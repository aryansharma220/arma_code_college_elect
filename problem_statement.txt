Election Website for College Students
Design and develop a secure and efficient election website for college students. This web application will facilitate the election of Class Representatives (CRs), Department Representatives (DRs), and other essential student representatives through a transparent and user-friendly online voting system. The application should feature an admin portal for election management, secure authentication for voters, and a real-time vote counting mechanism. This challenge aims to create a scalable, user-friendly, and secure online election system for college students. Participants are encouraged to think critically about efficiency, security, and usability, ensuring a smooth and fair electoral process for all students.
Election Structure
1st Year Students:
There are three streams, each having Class Representatives (CR) as follows::
Natural Sciences: 1 Male (M) and 1 Female (F)
Engineering Sciences: 1 Gender Neutral (GN)
Economic Sciences: 1 GN

2nd Year Students:
Natural Sciences: Each department (Bio, Chm, Maths, EES, DSE, Phy) elects 1 CR.
Engineering Sciences: 1 CR
Economic Sciences: 1 CR
In Natural Sciences, students can have up to 3 pre-majors. For Engineering and Economic Sciences, pre-major is labeled as the stream name itself.
3rd Year Students:
Natural Sciences: Each department (Bio, Chm, Maths, EES, DSE, Phy) elects one Department Representative (DR).
Engineering Sciences: Each department (EECS, DSE, CHE) elects one DR.
Economic Sciences: DR election follows the same scheme.
4th & 5th Year Students:
Follows the same scheme as 3rd year.
Additional Elections (All Years):
2 Mess Representatives
2 Girls Hostel Representatives
2 Boys Hostel Representatives

Roll Number
Email ID
Gender
Year of Study
Stream (for 1st Year Students)
Pre-majors (for 2nd Year Students)
Department (for 3rd-5th Year Students)
Implementation Requirements
Participants must develop a fully functional web application with the following key features:
Admin Portal:
Admin authentication system.
Ability to add candidates for election positions (based on the year-wise structure).
Upload student voter data via a CSV file or manual input.
Automated email(on existing email) distribution to eligible voters with a unique voting passkey.
Real-time tracking of voting progress.
Voter Portal:
Passkey-based authentication to ensure secure voting.
Dynamic ballot generation – voters should only see the positions they are eligible to vote for.
Person gets OTP when he try to enter the voting page through the form.
Save votes anonymously (That is store only the count, not the person who voted).
Confirmation message upon successful vote submission.
Security and Integrity Measures:
Unique, non-reusable passkeys for each voter.
Data encryption for vote storage and transmission.
Prevention of duplicate voting or unauthorized access.
Audit log for admin actions.
Bonus Section
Participants will receive bonus points for implementing a dynamic position management system where:
Admins can create new election positions dynamically.
Admins can assign eligibility criteria for each position using filters (e.g., gender = male, year = 1st, stream = Engineering, etc.). Filters need to be added through UI itself.
The voting system automatically adjusts based on these custom positions and filters, ensuring that only eligible students can vote for the created positions.
